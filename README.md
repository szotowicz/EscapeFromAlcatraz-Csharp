>The first independent project in C#. Adventure of the language began with the creation of a test project with a very original name "WindowsFormsApplication1," but it quickly became apparent that work with this technology is really enjoyable. Thus was born the idea of writing a logic game, which consists in shifting the keys in such a way that all were on the padlocks. Then they open the door to the next room.

>The game has 30 different rooms. Initially, the task we have to move only one key, but after going a few levels, it turns out that the the keys arrives, and the degree of difficulty increases. Moreover that implemented the option to memorize the current game room, so we can safely turn off the game without having to worry about losing our progress.
